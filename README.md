# 📊 Stock Market Risk & Return Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **risk and return analysis of stocks** using Python.
Instead of focusing on stock price prediction, this analysis emphasizes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **volatility assessment**, **correlations**, and **Value at Risk (VaR)** to better understand financial risk.

It is designed as a **portfolio-ready project** to showcase practical skills in:
- Financial data collection
- Statistical risk analysis
- Data visualization
- Insight-driven storytelling

Recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators can quickly see how financial analysis concepts are implemented in Python.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python** 🐍
- **yfinance** → fetch historical stock data
- **pandas & numpy** → data wrangling and calculations
- **matplotlib & seaborn** → visualization
- **scipy** → statistical operations

---

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **📥 Data Collection**
   - Fetch historical stock data (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.) using `yfinance`.

2. **🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Inspect data summary, check for missing values, visualize stock price trends.

3. **📈 Daily Returns**
   - Compute and plot daily returns.
   - Analyze volatility and return distributions.

4. **📊 Moving Averages**
   - Calculate 20-day and 50-day moving averages.
   - Identify short-term momentum vs. long-term trends.

5. **🤝 Correlation Analysis**
   - Compute correlation matrix of returns.
   - Visualize with heatmaps to evaluate diversification opportunities.

6. **⚠️ Value at Risk (VaR)**
   - Estimate downside risk at 95% and 99% confidence levels.
   - Interpret maximum expected daily losses.

7. **💡 Insights & Conclusion**
   - Summarize key findings on volatility, diversification, and risk exposure.
   - Provide actionable takeaways for portfolio management.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Volatility:** Tech stocks show higher fluctuations, implying greater risk.
- **Diversification:** Correlation analysis reveals which stocks move together vs. independently.
- **Risk Exposure:** VaR quantifies potential maximum daily losses, providing a clear threshold for downside risk.

✅ **Takeaway:** This project demonstrates strong skills in **financial data analysis, risk quantification, and visualization** — making it highly relevant for **Data Analyst / Data Science roles in finance**.
